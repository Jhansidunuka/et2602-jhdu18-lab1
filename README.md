This project implements a command line chat system, based on TCP. 
a) TCP Chat Client
Implement a simple chat-client. Must be able to set IP:PORT and nickname at runtime, e.g. using command-line arguments. See protocol description below. There is a testing-server at 18.219.51.6:4711, 13.53.35.7:4711 and 13.53.76.30:4711. For user-input you should read non-blocking without echo.

b) TCP Chat Server
Implement a chat-server which is compatible with the chat-client. It must be able to handle multiple users simultaneous. # et2602-jhdu18-lab1
